        <span class="chartext"><p>An esteemed captain of space and the leader of his own team...who wouldn't follow such a charistmatic leader into this game?
            Steering the missions like one of his own spaceships, Fox grips the leadership wheel expectedly well, displaying confidence and a fervor to win.
            He's clever, always ready to flash a grin, but
            also cares very deeply about the other players as a team. 
            Fox joins with a motivated attitude, even inspiring feelings of unity and teamwork 
            among everyone within just the first five minutes of the game. A noble captain indeed...but could he be the Mole?

            questionable
            motives. She is sweet, kind, and ultimately the fairest of them all. As a natural overseer and ruler of her kingdom,
            she finds exerting copious amounts of stress in the game of 'The Mole' as unnecessary, preferring much more to sit back and hope
            the rest of the game goes smoothly. She also seems to understand the game very well and uses it to her advantage.
             But where does she get her knowledge from? Could it be that Peach may be the traitor aboard?

            You actually see him vigorously hollering for more than half of the time he's in the game, either passionately with a large smile or angrily with palpable fury.
            DK jumps right into missions, ready to play. But this boisterous guy actually doesn't care how the game goes: all this energetic ape 
            really wants
        is to have a good time. But does that mean he'll do it by covertly sabotaging the game as the chosen agent?

           How stylish, intelligent, and sneaky do you want your Mole player to be? Joker, a show-off in his ways and excelling both mentally and physically in challenges,
           fits almost every criteria for a Mole player. He does his best to play well, which is why he claims he can't be the Mole.
            Yet, he has many tricks up his sleeve, and maybe the moments he <i>does</i> help
            are just instances when others are looking at him. He doesn't want to cause havoc...does he? 
            OR, are his masked, subtle smiles just deceptions as the selected deceiver?

        <span class="chartext jokerp"><p>Wii Fit is one of the strongest players both physically...and tauntingly. "I hope you don't mind second place," she teases. She is sassy in her sentiments and as pompous as she is pretentious. Wii Fit eagerly boasts
            an active body, and unfortunately for some others, an active mind that's not afraid to speak 
            what she's thinking. Much to her own chuckles, she knows she can sometimes appear rather condescending and brash
            to others. But when she does see strength and value in someone else...she 
            tends to treat them nicely. Hmm...what an interesting character...if this trainer 
            were indeed the treacherous traitor.
