          <div class="newchartext"><p>A captain of space and leader of his own team...who wouldn't follow the dashing, charismatic Fox McCloud into the game of <q>The Mole</q> ?
            This fox enters the game with both confidence and strong fervor to win determinedly.
            He's clever, always ready to flash a grin, but then also cares
            deeply about the other players as a team. 
            Fox enters very much with a motivated attitude, even inspiring feelings of unity and teamwork 
            among everyone within just the first five minutes of the game. A noble captain indeed...but is he the Mole?</p>

            <div class="newchartext"><p>The most loyal and dainty of all...the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom joins the game with a carefree demeanor and
                questionable
                motives. She is sweet, kind, and ultimately fair...but though a natural ruler,
                she finds exerting copious amounts of stress in the game unnecessary, preferring more to sit back and hope
                the game goes smoothly. She also seems to understand the game well and uses it to her advantage.
                 But, where does she get her knowledge from? Could it be that Peach may be the traitor aboard?</p></div>

        <div class="newchartext"><p>He's the first member of the DK crew...and also the first, well, <i>only</i> player to introduce himself into the game via loud YELL.
            You actually see him vigorously hollering for more than half of the time he's in the game, either passionately with a large smile or angrily with palpable fury.
            DK jumps right into missions, ready to play. But this boisterous guy actually doesn't care how the game goes: all this energetic ape 
            really wants is to have a great, good time. But does that mean he'll do it by covertly sabotaging the game as the chosen, roaring agent?</div>

            <h2 style="color: rgba(124, 124, 124, 0.973);">Joker</h2>
        <div class="newchartext"><p>
           How stylish, intelligent, and sneaky do you want your Mole player to be? Joker, a show-off in his ways and excellent both mentally and physically in challenges,
           fits almost every criteria for a Mole player. He does his best to play well, which is why he justifies he can't be the Mole.
            Yet, he has many tricks up his sleeve, and maybe the moments he <i>does</i> help
            are just instances when others are looking at him. He doesn't want to cause havoc...does he? 
            OR, are his subtle smiles just deceptions as the masked deceiver?

        <h2 style="color: rgba(40, 248, 255, 0.973);">Wii Fit</h2>
        <div class="newchartext"><p>Wii Fit is perhaps the strongest both physically....and tauntingly. "I hope you don't mind second place," she teases. She is sassy in her sentiments and pompously pretentious.
            Wii Fit boasts
            an active body...and unfortunately for others, an active mind too that's not afraid to speak 
            what she's thinking. With chuckles, she knows she can sometimes appear rather condescending and brash
            to others. But when she does see strength and value in someone else...she 
            treats them nicely. Hmm...very interesting...if this trainer 
            were indeed the treacherous traitor.

    <h2 style="color: rgba(238, 255, 6, 0.973);">Isabelle</h2>
<div class="newchartext"><p>
    Isabelle is a little out of place for such a game like this,
    but she joins enthusiastically! She's ready to apply all of her accomplished skills and experiences
     as a busy assistant from her office setting into this very game...which...may apply well or not work out so well, unfortunately.
    Though she may not be the best in the game's physical portions, she's very smart and practical. She's just cheerfully optimistic and she's also able to play very well overall.
    But do you know who else must be smart, practical, and cheerful in order to deceive their opponents throughout this game? The Mole...as small as they may be.

    <h2 style="color: rgba(9, 42, 151, 0.973);">Lucina</h2>
<div class="newchartext"><p>
    Lucina dives into battle, humbly and readily. She encompasses many emotions and deep feelings as she plays through this game; sometimes determination, sometimes confidence...yet then, 
    sometimes worry, and sometimes sadness. She is all-around
    a strong player, and her strengths and weaknesses show at the best and worst of times. But above all,
    Lucina believes in honor, still fulfilling her role and image as a warrior princess in this game. How
    will she unmask the Mole...or...is it herself that she'll end up revealing in the end, playing the role of agent with honor?

    <h2 style="color: rgba(15, 127, 255, 0.973);">Lucario</h2>
<div class="newchartext"><p>
    Lucario knows your soul: every aura in the air is picked up by this skilled, alert Pokemon. But don't be scared of him! Joining the game, this calm creature comes with a ready mind 
   and focused outlook. Lucario's key to keeping his 
   relaxed personality? His meditation...but he states to us that it's quite hard to do so with 
   nine other players waiting to deceive him at every second. Almost acting like the peacekeeper of the game, Lucario does his 
   best to keep everyone and also himself in their own worlds of balance and harmony. He indeed wants harmony for the group...or is 
   that just a false divertion as the Pokemon saboteur?

    <h2 style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.973);">Dark Pit</h2>
<div class="newchartext"><p>
    He's a little edgy and a little mopey, and very much in the dark most of the time. 
    But Dark Pit joins the game willingly, even if most of him is full of conflicted emotions and goals.
     He often takes offense to what others think of him, not liking any nicknames or any deriding comments 
     directed towards him...and he's ready to fight back too.
    Dark Pit may <i>look</i> like the most unwilling player...but in truth, part of him kinda wants to play the game, despite all of his side grumbles.
    Let's see how he does in this game, speaking if he isn't the young angel of betrayal.

    <h2 style="color: rgba(245, 0, 0, 0.973);">Kazooie</h2>
<div class="newchartext"><p>
    What's Kazooie doing here? Well, she asks herself the same question. But don't underestimate this red bird: she's 
    nonchalant, street-smart, and pretty much doesn't really care what others think of her or her actions: 
    undeniably key qualities for a Mole player. 
    Usually with her sidekick Banjo but now separated, Kazooie decided to play in this game for the promise of adventure...and food.
    Anyways, she doesn't really take this game seriously. Her goal is just to fly and make it as far possible. Far fly from the deceiver! ...or is Kazooie herself the Mole?
